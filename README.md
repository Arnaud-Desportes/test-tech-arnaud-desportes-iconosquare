# Technical test by Arnaud Desportes.

## The purpose of this technical test is to validate a ``minimum level`` of knowledge in ReactJS
The purpose of this technical test is to validate a minimum level of knowledge in `ReactJS` by demonstrating my ability to start a project that uses `React` and the Css framwork `Tailwind`, in order to drive an external API: [https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com](jsonplaceholder),
to generate a user list,
their profiles
and their personal data.

The test goes further by offering different routes like their profile pages that display a list of their posts and the comments related to them in a secondary view.

The project includes other features such as the ability to publish a post on a user's profile.

This test was done without any graphic model, a simple creative layout was done on the spot to show the soul of a front-end developer that sleeps in me ;)
## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App].
This project uses the Tailwind css framwork to speed up the creation process.

After installing all the dependencies, In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
